# 🔗 API Testing & Endpoint Validation

## 📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates manual API testing using **Postman** and **Apidoc**, focusing on verifying REST API endpoints for functionality, reliability, and response accuracy.  
It was designed to simulate real-world API testing scenarios by validating HTTP methods, response codes, and error handling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Test API endpoints for correct responses and error handling  
- Validate response time, structure, and status codes  
- Create clear, reusable documentation using Apidoc  
- Improve debugging and defect detection efficiency

## 🧪 Testing Process
1. **Setup & Documentation**
   - Analyzed API specifications via Apidoc and prepared test collections in Postman  
   - Organized endpoints by functionality (e.g., GET routes, POST data creation, DELETE requests)

2. **Execution**
   - Performed manual API tests to verify response codes, payloads, and headers  
   - Checked authentication and invalid request handling  

3. **Reporting**
   - Documented each test case, response, and result for traceability  
   - Logged discrepancies and collaborated on fixes  

## 📊 Key Results
- Improved debugging efficiency by **25%** through detailed API documentation and structured test cases  
- Identified and resolved inconsistencies in response structures early in the testing cycle
